### **RESEARCH & INNOVATION**

**PhD Research: AI-Enhanced Adaptive Trading Frameworks**
_University of Mauritius | September 2025 – Present_

- **The Challenge:** Traditional algorithmic trading fails during "regime shifts" (e.g., market crashes or volatility spikes).
- **The Innovation:** Developing a **"Multi-AI" Ecosystem** that operates exclusively on technical indicators. The system utilizes a "Master Strategy" algorithm to autonomously switch between specialized neural networks (LSTM vs. MLP) based on real-time market state detection.
- **Key Tech:** Python, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Transformers, Volatility Modeling.

**BSc Capstone: Automated Web Application Auditing Framework**
_Leeds Beckett University | 2020_

- **The Innovation:** Architected an **Automated Web Application Auditing Framework with AI Integration**.
- **Technical Approach:** Designed intelligent, rule-based automation logic to autonomously scan, detect, and classify web vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS) without human intervention.
- **Impact:** This research was pivotal in achieving **First Class Honours** and receiving the university's highest academic distinction.
