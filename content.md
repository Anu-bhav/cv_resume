## Research & Innovation

### PhD Research: AI-Enhanced Adaptive Trading Frameworks

**University of Mauritius** | _September 2025 – Present_

- **The Challenge:** Traditional algorithmic trading fails during "regime shifts" (e.g., market crashes or volatility spikes).
- **The Innovation:** Developing a **"Multi-AI" Ecosystem** that operates exclusively on technical indicators. The system utilizes a "Master Strategy" algorithm to autonomously switch between specialized neural networks (LSTM vs. MLP) based on real-time market state detection.
- **Key Tech:** Python, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Transformers, Volatility Modeling.

### BSc Capstone: Automated Web Application Auditing Framework

**Leeds Beckett University** | _2020_

- **The Innovation:** Architected an **Automated Web Application Auditing Framework with AI Integration**.
- **Technical Approach:** Designed intelligent, rule-based automation logic to autonomously scan, detect, and classify web vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS) without human intervention.
- **Impact:** This research was pivotal in achieving **First Class Honours** and receiving the university's highest academic distinction.
