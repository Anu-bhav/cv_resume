**RE: Inquiry regarding opportunities in AI, Cybersecurity, and Engineering**

Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to introduce my profile as a specialist working at the intersection of **Advanced Artificial Intelligence** and **Offensive Cybersecurity**. With a career starting in 2018 that blends academic research with practical operational experience, I bring a multidisciplinary perspective that uses machine learning to solve complex problems while maintaining strict security standards.

My experience focuses on three core areas:

**1. Advanced AI & Research Innovation:**
As a PhD Candidate, I am currently building "Multi-AI" systems designed for high-volatility markets. My work goes beyond theory; I focus on the practical implementation of various neural networks, including **Transformers, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), LSTMs, RNNs, CNNs, and MLPs**. I specialise in selecting and optimising the right model for the specific task at hand, solving challenges related to non-stationary data to create adaptive, automated decision-making systems.

**2. Offensive Security & Digital Forensics:**
My background is built on offensive security operations and forensic investigation. I have deep hands-on experience with industry-standard ecosystems, using **Kali Linux** for full-scope **penetration testing** and vulnerability assessments against the **OWASP Top 10** framework. Additionally, I am proficient with digital forensics tools like **EnCase** and **XRY** for conducting detailed investigations. Currently working towards my **OSCP** certification, I approach security with a "Red Team" mindset—understanding exactly how systems are compromised in order to defend them better.

**3. Engineering & Leadership:**
Beyond research, I am also an educator and technical strategist. My experience ranges from full-stack development (C#, ASP.NET) to leading the Advanced Networking and Security curriculum at the **IT Academy**. In this role, I designed training modules that prepared students for real-world **network defence**, ensuring they mastered the details of secure infrastructure and threat mitigation.

I am looking for a challenging role where I can combine these skills—one where I can use my ability to develop intelligent strategies that are efficient, data-driven, and mathematically sound.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how this hybrid expertise can add value to your organisation. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,

**Anubhavsingh Sawdagur**
